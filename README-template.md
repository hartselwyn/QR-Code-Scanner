**What I learned**
This project helped reinforce my knowledge of HTML structure and CSS styling. Here are a few highlights of what I learned:

Centering a Container: Using margin: auto; and specifying width allowed me to center the main .qr-container div on the page.

*css*
.qr-container {
    width: 20%;
    margin: auto;
}

Responsive Design with Media Queries: I used a media query to adjust the width of the container on smaller screens.
*css*
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    .qr-container {
        width: 90%;
    }
}

**Continued development**
In future projects, I aim to:
Further develop my responsive design skills.
Experiment with CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
Explore more CSS animations to enhance user interactions.

**Useful resources**
